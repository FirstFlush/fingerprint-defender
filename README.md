# Fingerprint Defender (WIP)

**Fingerprint Defender** is a browser extension (built for Firefox) that helps users resist browser fingerprinting by generating a realistic, randomized browser identity for each session.

Instead of using fake or obviously spoofed values, this extension analyzes key details from the real environment—such as screen size, language preferences, and timezone offset—and selects a plausible fingerprint profile that blends into real-world data.

Each session gets a fresh identity, including:
- User agent string
- Screen resolution
- Timezone
- Device type (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Language preferences
- And more to come...

This project is in early development and is not yet ready for installation. More details on installation, configuration, and usage will be added once the core spoofing logic is complete.

**Goal:** help users blend into large anonymity sets while preserving usability and avoiding obviously fake fingerprints.
